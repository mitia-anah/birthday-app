# Birthday app

## structure of the code:
In this project, I built a 'birthday app'. At first I created html document for the `table` element, the form for the `search` box and the `add button` which shows a new form to fill when it is clicked. When everything set up, then I worked on javascript code to do the rest of the elements, such as the `form` of the popup to edit, `div` popup to show a delete comfirmation box and etc. To get all of the people's lists, I used `fetch` to fetch the data from the `people.json`.  

## Improvement
If I had more time, I would like to work on the css because I want my project to be responsive. What's more, I may have tried another technic, which is easy to read and understandable code to get the date function work rather than having so complicated code.

## Lessons learned

## Bigest challenge
What struggled me the most was to store the data to the local storage. The thing is, when I started to add the local storage function, everything didn't work anymore. It took me more time to get it solved.

## More eplanation
I would like to have more explanation with the date function because I tried to use it but gave me an error.
